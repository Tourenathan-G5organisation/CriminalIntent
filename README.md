# CriminalIntent
CriminalIntent is an Android app that records the details of “office crimes”– things like leaving dirty dishes in the breakroom sink or walking away from an empty shared printer after documents have printed.
This app is being developed in the course of going through an Android book called 'The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (2nd Edition)'. I thank the author of this book for his great Work in writting this book for us.
